# Covid19-analysis-and-visualization

This is a covid 19 data exploratory and visualization project. Using SQL, divded into various data cuts to look into meaningful insights and created a dashboard using Tableau


AdvertureWorks Report

This report offers a comprehensive view into the overall performance of AdventureWorks, a global manufacturer specializing in cycling gear and accessories.

The analysis consisted of several key stages:

1) Data Extraction: Collecting all necessary data using PowerQuery.
2) Data Cleansing: Identifying and addressing duplicate entries, errors, and patterns.
3)Data Transformation: Introducing additional columns to calculate various metrics like Start of the Week, Start of the Month, Year, and Average Retail Price, among others..
4) Data Modeling: Establishing one-to-many relationships between different data tables.
5) Data Processing/Manipulation: Generating new calculated columns and metrics such as Total Transactions, Total Profit, Total Returns, Return Rate, Revenue Target, and 90-Day Revenue, among others.
6) Data Visualization: Constructing an interactive dashboard featuring key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, charts, and a matrix.

A few noteworthy insights gleaned from the dashboard are as follows:

1) The United States dominates the proportion of total orders compared to Canada, Australia, and Europe.
2) Monthly Revenue has decreased in comparison to the preceding month.
3) Monthly orders have experienced a decrease as compared to the previous month.
4) Monthly return rate has also decreased which is considered as a positive point.

I'd like to express my gratitude to Maven Analytics for their instrumental role in furnishing me with a strong foundational understanding of PowerBI through their course.
